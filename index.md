## Coding Solve for Return Of The Coder

This is the coding solver for the witch's village problem.

### How I Solve

I look at the evil witch is indeed an mathematician and also a coder. He kill people with Fibonanci Sum series (bad, bad, bad witch). As a hero, I try to create a program that solve its witch problem.

First, I create a class named Fibonanci, which I reside all the code of Fibonanci there. Its a static class. On that class, I created two methods:

1. Fib: this method, is compute which number for i-th fibonanci series will get
2. Sum: this method to compute sum of fibonanci until i-th.

After that, I created class named Village to set properties off Village like _age of death_, _year of death_, _year_, and _number of death_ at the year of substract year of death and age of death. On that class, I created methods:

1. Add: to add person into a list
2. Average: to get average of number of death
3. Answer: to show the answer into console

### Thanks
I would say thank you for give me this opportunity
